# Automating aspects of content creation

This code does not replace good-old-fashioned hard work, not yet ;), but it does contain experimentation around auto-generating blog posts. Most of these experiments are contained in the ipython notebooks. You'll need to provide your own API keys for the various resources consumed.

I'm open to other ideas you might have to further the projects contained here. Just shoot me a message.
